# Grocy Ticket Importer — Home Assistant

Despensa is a Home Assistant add-on that manages a Grocy pantry with a mobile barcode scanner, searchable inventory, product editing and receipt imports.

## Installation and configuration

Add the repository URL in **Settings → Apps → Install app → ⋮ → Repositories**. Install **Grocy Ticket Importer**, then open its **Configuration** tab and set:

- `grocy_url`: internal Grocy URL reachable from the add-on (for example `http://a0d7b954-grocy:80`).
- `grocy_api_key`: Grocy API key (password field).
- `openai_api_key`: OpenAI API key for receipt extraction (password field).
- `grocy_location_id`: target Grocy location ID (defaults to 2).

Do not commit keys, receipts or databases to GitHub. Credentials are loaded at startup from the Home Assistant managed `/data/options.json`; `.env` is not needed in the add-on.

## Existing local installation — read before switching repositories

**Do not uninstall the existing local add-on until the receipt ledger has been backed up and migrated.** A repository add-on has a different Home Assistant app ID from the local add-on, even when its slug matches.

The receipt import ledger is `grocy_imports.sqlite3` in the add-on's private `app_config` directory. For an existing installation, first **copy** (never move) that file to the remote add-on's `app_config` folder. Keep the original local add-on running until the new one has been verified. Back up via Home Assistant before migration.

For a completely new installation the add-on creates an empty ledger. An existing imported-ticket user must **never** skip migration: doing so may import receipts twice. No existing ledger is deleted or overwritten by the bootstrap.

The session key and receipt upload working files are in `/data` and managed by Home Assistant backups. Do not expose the internal ingress service directly to the internet.

## Updates

Home Assistant detects a new version when the app's `config.yaml` version changes in the added GitHub repository. Choose **Check for updates** in the app store if necessary. The repository must be publicly readable by Supervisor; keeping GitHub source public does **not** make Grocy API keys public.
